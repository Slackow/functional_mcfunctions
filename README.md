# Functional McFunctions
This Project Serves as "compiler" for mcfunction files.
The main point of this application is to allow functions to be defined inside of other functions. 

Running the JAR file will open a JavaFX app that will allow you to compile files.
You can either select a minecraft world's folder, to compile all
the datapacks in that save, or you can select a specific datapack.
(Not the data folder)

Additionally, if there is no `pack.mcmeta`, 
one will be generated automatically.

If you'd like to know more about the syntax, it is recommended you read the 
wiki page on github.

Note: This project may not run on Java 11+
